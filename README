OANotes for rails
=======

"OANotes" as in "Orion's Apotomo Notes".
This Notes widget makes easy to add notes functionality to any rails application.


Pre-requisits
=============

OAWidget, see: http://github.com/Orion98MC/oa_widget
will_paginate for notes pagination, see: http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate


Install
=======

$ cd my_rails_app
$ ./script/plugins install git://github.com/Orion98MC/oa_notes.git

Then, you have to sync the public resources of the plugin to your app's public directory:

$ rake oa_notes:sync_resources

Since you want to manage Notes, you need to have a note model.
By default, OANotes assumes you have a "Note" model. You may create one with the following:

$ ./script/generate model Note content:text
$ rake db:migrate

If you already have a model for the notes you must specify :notes => "MyNoteClass"



About styling and javascript include:
-------------------------------------

Since the OAWidget and OANotes widgets use custom styling and javascript tools, you must include the stylesheets and javacripts in the head of your layout. To help you include the correct set of files, there are helper methods which output the list of required files:

  #oa_widget_javascripts
  #oa_notes_javascripts
  #oa_widget_stylesheets
  #oa_notes_stylesheets

Example of includes to add in app/views/layouts/application.html.haml:
...
  %head
    ...
    = javascript_include_tag oa_widget_javascripts, oa_notes_javascripts
    = stylesheet_link_tag oa_widget_stylesheets, oa_notes_stylesheets

Authorizations:
===============
By default, all is allowed, to allow/forbid delete/create/update/mark notes you can create a Authorizations module in OANote module
Put it in app/cells/oa_notes.rb, here is an example:

module OANotes
  module Authorizations
    def delete?(note)
      can? :delete, note
    end

    def create?(note)
      can? :create, note.class
    end

    def update?(note)
      can? :update, note
    end
    
    def toogle_mark?(note)
      can? :toogle_mark, note
    end
  end
end

Example:
========
in app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb:
class DashboardController < ApplicationController
  include Apotomo::Rails::ControllerMethods
  ...
  has_widgets do |root|
    root < OANotes::Container.new('notes', 
      :title => 'My notes', 
      :notes => "@current_user.notes", # assuming user has many notes 
      :search => :search, 
      :note_partial => 'partials/user_note',
    )
  end
  
  def show
    #assuming @current_user is already set here
  end
  ...
end

in app/views/dashboard/show.haml.html:
...
  = render_widget 'notes'
...

in app/cells/partials/_user_notes.html.haml
%p
  %span= note.created_at
  = note.content


example 1:
----------

has_widgets do |root|
  root << OANotes::Container.new('notes', :title => 'My notes')
end

> This creates a Notes widget named 'notes' with a special title.


example 2:
----------

has_widgets do |root|
  root << OANotes::Container.new('notes', 
	:title => 'My notes',
	:hide => [:form],
	:search => :search,
	:views => [['All', nil], ['Recent', :recent]],
	:sorts => [['Date (^)', :by_date_asc], ['Date (v)', :by_date_desc]]
	)
end

> This creates a Notes widget with a hidden form (you can create new notes but the form is hidden by default),
  the notes are searchable, using the :search named scope of the model,
  two views are allowed, one for viewing all records, the other for viewing recent notes using the :recent named scope of the model
  two sorts are allowed, on for sorting creation date ascending using a :by_date_asc named scope of the model.

The Note model could look like this:
class Note < ActiveRecord::Base
	named_scope :search, lambda{|arg| 
	  query = (arg.is_a? AONotes::Container) ? arg.search_text : arg
	  {:conditions => ["content LIKE ?", "%#{query}%"]}
	}
	
	named_scope :recent, lambda{ {:conditions => ["updated_at >= ?", 2.days.ago]}}
	named_scope :by_date_asc, lambda{ {:order => "created_at ASC"}}
	named_scope :by_date_desc, lambda{ {:order => "created_at DESC"}}
end
