OANotes for rails
=======

"OANotes" as in "Orion's Apotomo Notes".
This Notes widget makes easy to add notes functionality to any rails application.


Pre-requisits
=============

OAWidget, see: http://github.com/Orion98MC/oa_widget


Install
=======

$ cd my_rails_app
$ ./script/plugins install git://github.com/Orion98MC/oa_widget.git

Then, you have to sync the public resources of the plugin to your app's public directory:

$ rake oa_notes:sync_resources

Since you want to manage Notes, you need to have a note model.
By default, OANotes assumes you have a "Note" model. You may create one with the following:

$ ./script/generate model Note content:text
$ rake db:migrate

If you already have a model for the notes you must define an Adapter module to tell OANotes how to interract with it:

in app/cells/ao_notes.rb:
module OANotes
  module Adapter
    def note_class
      MyNote
    end
  end
end


Usage
=====

#  OANotes::Container.new("notes", OPTIONS)
#
#  OPTIONS: A hash with following options:
#
#  :hide => [:search, :filters, :content, :form]
#  :scope => a named_scope for the model, this will be the default named scope for search, pagination etc...
#  :search => a named scope for the model, this will be used to search
#  :has_markings? => true or false (default: false)
#  :toogle_mark! => a model method name, the method is called with note as attribute
#  :marked? => a model method name, the method is called with note as attribute
#  :views => [['My scope 1', :scope1], ...] an array of named scopes for view filter 
#  :sorts => [['My filter 1', :filter1], ...] an array of named scopes for the sorting filter
#  :pages => [['5', 5], ['Many', 100], ...] an array of per_pages for the per_page filter
#  :details => a lambda or proc to be evaluated against the note to display the note content
#  :form => a lambda or proc to be evaluated against the note and display the note form
#  :eval_options => array of options to be evaluated before being called
#  :title => string, this is the title to be displayed in the widget's title bar
#  :save => lambda called when the user clicks on "save". It receives an argument, a hash containing the live configuration of the widget


example 1:
----------

has_widgets do |root|
  root << OANotes::Container.new('notes', :title => 'My notes')
end

> This creates a Notes widget named 'notes' with a special title.


example 2:
----------

has_widgets do |root|
  root << OANotes::Container.new('notes', 
	:title => 'My notes',
	:hide => [:form],
	:search => :search,
	:views => [['All', nil], ['Recent', :recent]],
	:sorts => [['Date (^)', :by_date_asc], ['Date (v)', :by_date_desc]]
	)
end

> This creates a Notes widget with a hidden form (you can create new notes but the form is hidden by default),
  the notes are searchable, using the :search named scope of the model,
  two views are allowed, one for viewing all records, the other for view recent notes using the :recent named scope of the model
  two sorts are allowed, on for sorting creation date ascending using a :by_date_asc named scope of the model.

The Note model could look like this:
class Note < ActiveRecord::Base
	named_scope :search, lambda{|arg| 
	  query = (arg.is_a? Apotomo::Widget) ? arg.search_text : arg
	  {:conditions => ["content LIKE ?", "%#{query}%"]}
	}
	
	named_scope :recent, lambda{ {:conditions => ["updated_at >= ?", 2.days.ago]}}
	named_scope :by_date_asc, lambda{ {:order => "created_at ASC"}}
	named_scope :by_date_desc, lambda{ {:order => "created_at DESC"}}
end


example 3:
----------

has_widgets do |root|
  root << OANotes::Container.new('notes', 
	:title => 'My notes',
	:details => "lambda {|note| render :partial => 'partials/note_details', :locals => {:note => note}}"
	:eval_options => [:details]
	)
end

> The only difference is that each note detail is rendered by a partial.
